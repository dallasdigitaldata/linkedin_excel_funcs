# ExcelToPython

This repository is designed to help Excel users transition to Python for data analysis, focusing on recreating popular Excel functions, charts, and advanced data handling techniques. For those who prefer to keep Excel as their primary tool, these resources also demonstrate how Python can be integrated with Excel to unlock powerful machine learning and advanced data processing capabilities.
